		What is Ionic Framework?
		<br>
		<br>
		Ionic is a complete open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development.
	
		<br>
		Built on top of AngularJS and Apache Cordova (formerly PhoneGap), Ionic provides tools and services for developing hybrid mobile apps using Web technologies like CSS, HTML5, and Sass.
	
		<br>
		Apps can be built with these Web technologies and then distributed through native app stores to be installed on devices by leveraging Cordova.
</p>

<p>
		The History of Ionic Framework
	
		<br>
		Ionic was created by Max Lynch, Ben Sperry, and Adam Bradley of Drifty Co. in 2013.
	
		<br>
		Taking feedback from customers who tried to build mobile apps, the team decided to build their own framework that would focus on performance and be built with modern Web standards, Ionic 1.0 was released in May 2015.

		<br>
		In 2015 Ionic developers reportedly created over 1.3M apps with the SDK
</p>

<p>
		<br>
		Why use Ionic Framework?
	
		<br>
		TL;DR: "Ionic’s ultimate goal is to make it easier to develop native mobile apps with HTML5, also known as Hybrid apps.”

		<br>
		App Types:
		<ul>
				<li> Native: What you install from the App Store
						+ : Fast, Advanced UI capabilities ||  - : OS specific/limited</li>
				<li> HTML5:  Your typical mobile site
						+:  Multi-Platform, Instant Updates || - : Slow, Lacking Advanced UI </li>
				<li> Hybrid: The Best of Both Worlds
						HTML5 Apps wrapped in a Native Container </li>
		</ul>

<p> 
		Get Started with Ionic Framework
		<br>

		First, install Node.js 4. 
		<br>

		Then, install the latest Cordova and Ionic command-line tools. Follow the Android and iOS platform guides to install required platform dependencies.
		<br>

		Create an Ionic project using one of their ready-made app templates, or a blank one to start fresh.
		<br>

		Use the Ionic tool to build, test, and run your apps (or use Cordova directly).
		<br>

		Then, try Ionic View to share your apps with testers and clients, or to easily test on new devices.
		<br>

		Export your application with Cordova.
		<br>

		You will still need to pay for developer privileges to publish to the Apple App Store ($99) or the Google Play Store ($25).
